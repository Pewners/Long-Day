# Games Beyond Entertainment Project (Fourth Project/Final Major Project 1)
We were assigned to create a game that touched on real world issues and our game was about drug addiction and how it affects the mental health.
This was a collaboration with Blaise-Eden Kombo and Clarence Veras.
Assigned in February 2022




Also, Project 3 is missing because I didn't like that project
